# Predicting-sentiment-from-product-reviews

The goal of this Project is to explore logistic regression and feature engineering 

you will use product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative. You will:

you can downlaod the dataset from [here](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_596922c59a7068d4eb7baa104c01a685_amazon_baby.csv.zip?Expires=1574899200&Signature=DzIVDKQjcXjpiZsNvYtnt6WSMJ-Gnypof6RScwYIIebiga5qXHav~XF~hPHViFwVp96Vu9E8k-c8NauNIwEgKx8Uad1kk6GG9QSO-PVZPi8BX9yYwaoltf-qvE2iM4k8YeO1GzsBckjpPJuphcWD~8rQ8N4Q-IfjEUyi-iuFpfc_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)

* Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.
* Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.
* Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.
* Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, 
* write a function to compute the accuracy of the model.
* Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.
* Compare multiple logistic regression models.
